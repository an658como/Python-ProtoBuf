Purged this stirred mixture by bubbling nitrogen through for an hour, then added the Palladium acetate. Heated to 130ÂºC in a metal block (block at 150ÂºC) and held at this temperature for 3 hours. LCMS (monitorbase) then showed DP as MH+ = 370.99 and MH- = 369.03 at 1.82 minutes, 84%. Allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness at 50ÂºC giving __ a dirty-yellow solid residue.  Treated with 150 ml water and the resulting yellow solid filtered off and washed with water. Dried by desiccation under high vacuum over phosphorous pentoxide at room temperature to constant weight. This afforded 11.98 g pale- yellow solid [A].  LCMS(monitorbase) showed it to be DP as MH+ = 370.99 and MH- = 369.03 at 1.83 minutes, 90%.  _ _ This material was crystallised from acetonitrile; dissolved up in ~1 litre boiling acetonitrile and the cloudy solution filtered hot through a fluted paper. Crystallisation of product from the filtrate was eventually achieved, with difficulty, by rapid cooling in drikold/acetone and seeding/scratching as it warmed up. Cooled in ice/water then the solid was collected by filtration and washed with chilled acetonitrile. Dried by desiccation under high vacuum at room temperature to constant weight. This afforded 6.03 g creamy-white solid [B].  LCMS (monitorbase) then showed DP as MH+ = 370.99 and MH- = 369.03 at 1.49 minutes, 96%.  Material B was combined with the same product from P14-A and this total of 7.32 g recrystallised from the minimum of acetonitrile (~550 ml) with hot filtration again to remove trace insoluble matter. Cooled in ice/water and seeded/scratched to induce crystallisation then stood in the fridge overnight. The solid was collected by filtration and washed with chilled acetonitrile. Dried by desiccation under high vacuum initially at room temperature, then at 60Â°C, to constant weight. This afforded 5.04 g creamy-white solid [C].  LCMS (monitorbase) then showed DP as MH+ = 371.06 and MH- = 369.08 at 1.85 minutes, 99%.  Unfortunately nmr showed entrapped acetonitrile at an unacceptable level (~0.5 equiv.). To remove this material C was stirred in ~100 ml ether for an hour, recollected and washed with ether. Dried at 60Â°C as before to constant weight. This afforded 4.73 g creamy-white solid [D].  BNL

This afforded 1.29 g creamy-white bulky solid [A].  LCMS (monitorbase) then showed DP as MH+ = 370.99 and MH- = 369.03 at 1.83 minutes, 99%.  BNL

Nitrogen was bubbled through the reaction mixture for 1 hour then PALLADIUM(II) ACETATE (0.435 g, 1.94 mmol) added. The suspension was stirred at 130 Â°C for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and filtered then evaporated to dryness. The residue was triturated with water (150 mL) and filtered to give crude product as a cream solid which was 90% pure by LCMS. The crude solid was triturated with hot MeCN (300 mL) to give a solid which was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give a cream solid (7.86g) which was 95% pure by LCMS. The solid was dissolved in the minimum amount of boiling MeCN (650 mL) and filtered to remove remaining trace solids. The filtrate was concentrated to approximately 400 mL and stirred at ice bath temperature until a precipitate formed. The suspension was stirred at room temperature overnight then filtered to afford a cream solid (6.4g) which was 100% pure by LCMS. Combined with EN02084-42 to get a single larger batch.  BNL

The reaction was heated to 150 Â°C for 30 minutes in the microwave reactor and cooled to RT. LC/MS showed completion.  The reaction mixture was concentrated and diluted with EtOAc , and washed sequentially with water and saturated brine. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated. The crude oil was triturated with EtOAc, Et2O and hexane to give a solid which was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give P1 N-(4-(5-chlorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-ylamino)pyridin-2-yl)acetamide (680mg, 38%)as a tan solid. NMR of this product showed product plus some DMA and aromatic impurities.  The filtrate from the the above was concentrated and triturated again to give P2 N-(4-(5-chlorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-ylamino)pyridin-2-yl)acetamide (800mg, 45%) as a pale orange solid. NMR of this product showed it to be much cleaner than P1.    B@>

To degassed 1,4-dioxane (39.2 ml) in a flame-dried and argonflushed 250 mL roundbottomed flask were added 5-fluoro-4-(2-methyl-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)-1H-imidazol-5-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine (1.076 g, 3.88 mmol) and 4-(4-chloro-3-fluorobenzyl)morpholine (0.9 g, 3.92 mmol) followed by POTASSIUM TERT-BUTOXIDE (0.572 g, 5.09 mmol) whilst stirring. The resulting slurry was flushed with argon and stirred for 5-10 minutes followed by addition of TRIS(DIBENZYLIDENEACETONE)DIPALLADIUM(0) (0.359 g, 0.39 mmol) and 2-Dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-tri-iso- propyl-1,1'-biphenyl (0.374 g, 0.78 mmol), whereafter the reaction mixture was flushed with argon again and heated to 102 Â°C and stirred under argon for 3 h. No further conversion occurred after 2 hours.  The completion of the reaction was controlled by HPLC and the crude mixture was cooled to ambient temperatuer and then filtrated through Celite and washed through with dichloromethane. The solution was concentrated in vacuo and dissolved in 14 ml dichloromethane and purified by ISCO and then by prep-HPLC.  The pooled fractions were concentrated in vacuo and added HCl to give 5-fluoro-N-(2-fluoro-4-(morpholinomethyl)phenyl)-4-(2-methyl-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)-1H-imidazol-5-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine (0.227 g, 11.43 %)      BSQ

The tube was then charged with nitrogen and dioxane (0.589 mL) was added. The tube was then evacuated again and placed under a nitrogen balloon for 8 hours. LC/MS confirmed formation of the product (m+1 = 418) at t= 2.07 min. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo leaing a brown solid (472 mg). This material was the redissolved in EtOAc, filtered through Celite, washed with water and dried with Na2SO4. Concentration in vacuo gave a rust solid (272 mg). This material was purified by ISCO (0-10% MeOH/DCM). Concentration of the fractions in vacuo gave an orange oil. This material was then repurifed by ISCO (4-8% MeOH/DCM) and (0-4% MeOH/DCM). Both gradients resulted in impure material, so the recovered orange oil was purified again by ISCO (60-100% EtOAc/Hex). Concentration in vacuo gave a yellow solid (34.8 mg). LC/MS showed this material to still be only 80% pure, so it was purified again by ISCO (55-95% EtOAc/Hex). A yellow solid (25.4 mg) was again collected. Although LC/MS and HPLC showed this material to be only ~80% pure, the NMR confirmed this material to be the desired product, (S)-N2-(1-(5-fluoropyrimidin-2-yl)ethyl)-N4-(5-methylthiazol-2-yl)-6-morpholino-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine, with 95% purity.  1H NMR (300 MHz, CHLOROFORM- _d_ ) d ppm 11.87 (br. s., 1 H) 9.48 (br. s., 1 H) 8.58 (s, 2 H) 7.01 (s, 1 H) 5.35 (t, 1 H) 3.28 - 4.23 (m, 8 H) 2.38 (s, 3 H) 1.59 (d, 4 H)    BSQ

The reaction was heated to 150 Â°C for 30 minutes in the microwave reactor and cooled to RT. This was combined with reactions EN01370-84-87 and concentrated. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 10% MeOH in DCM. Mixed fractions were combined and re-columned. This prcess was repeated a further 3 times! 'Pure' fractions were combined and evaporated to dryness to afford 6-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamino)-4-(2-methyl-1-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-8-ylamino)nicotinonitrile (484 mg, 15.63 %) as a yellow solid (1.08g) - 100% by LCMS and clean by TLC but the NMR is not great. Passed onto the purification group.The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC (Waters XBridge Prep C18 OBD column, 5Âµ silica, 19 mm diameter, 100 mm length), using decreasingly polar mixtures of water (containing 1% NH3) and MeCN as eluents. Fractions containing the desired compound were evaporated to dryness to afford the required product.  200mg trial purification - resulted in 137mg pure - EN01370-88-1  Rest of the material processed to give EN01370-88-2 (347mg and 177mg)  BPN

Then 5-fluoro-4-(2-methyl-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)-1H-imidazol-5-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine (9.98 g, 36 mmol), 4-(4-bromobenzyl)morpholine (9.48 g, 37 mmol), Sodium tert- pentoxide (6.34 g, 57.60 mmol) and toluene (200 mL) were added. The reaction mixture became sticky yellowish green. It was stirred at 100 Â°C under argon.  The reaction was followed by HPLC. After 3 h no conversion was obtained. The mixture was stirred overnight but the conversion did not move. Then the mixture was cooled to 50 ÂºC, Pd-complex (5 mol%) and Xantphos (6 mol%) as preactivated catalyst in toluene (100 ml) were added to the mixture, it was degassed carefully, then it was put under argon. Then the reaction mixture was heated at 100 ÂºC. After 1 h full conversion was detected.  The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with dichloromethane (600 mL), extracted with water (4*500 mL), washed with brine (1*500 mL) and dried over Na2SO4. Filtration and concentration afforded orange brown solid. This solid was slurried in EtOAc ( 50 mL) and stirred at reflux point (78 Â°C) for 10 min. Then it was cooled to room temperature with stirring and filtered. The filtercake was washed with _n_ -pentane (80 mL). Orange filtercake was obtained which still had some impurity.  The above obtained orange filtercake was slurried in EtOAc (80 mL) and stirred at 80 Â°C for 30 min. Then it was cooled to room t emperature and the precipitation was filtered. Yellow fine powder was obtained.  BPN

The total volume of the reaction mixture was deoxygenized carefully by switching vacuum-argon 10-times and heated to 110 Â°C under argon.  After 10 min the mixture turned into green. The reaction was monitored by HPLC, after 22 h only ca 65 %. The reactuion was stopped and the mixture was cooled to room temperature. Toluene was removed in vacuo. The residual was dissolved in dichloromethane ( 1.2 L) and extracted with water (2*1 L). The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc(600 mL). The combined orange organic phases were filtered through a celitepad and concetrated in vacuo. Dark orange brown sticky gum was obtained which solidified over 2 weeks.  This solid was slurried in EtOAc (60 mL) at reflux point for 1 h, then it was cooled to rt slowly with vigorous stirring. Filtration afforded a light yellow solid and an orange filtrate.  0.5 g of the filtercake was purified by preparative HPLC, it afforded 303 mg light yellow solid which was submitted to PARD directly (EN01460-38-001).  1.8 g of the filtercake was purified by preparative HPLC, it afforded 1.02 g light yellow solid and 1.015 g was submitted to PARD directly in a standard bascoded bottle (EN01460-38-002) (barcode: 30152995).  The residual material was used for recrystallization studies in the RSL group.  BPN

The orange pre-mixed Pd-catalyst solution were added to a 10 mL Schlenk-tube containing 4-(4-bromobenzyl)morpholine (0.282 g, 1.1 mmol) and Sodium tert- pentoxide (0.161 g, 1.46 mmol) in DME (1.5 mL). Finally, 5-fluoro-4-(2-methyl-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)-1H-imidazol-5-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine (0.277 g, 1 mmol) was added and the bright orange reaction mixture was stirred at 90 Â°C.  The mixture turned from bright orange into bright yellow in 1 h. The reaction was followed by HPLC. No reaction took place, hence the mixture was discarded.  BPN

A 250 mL roundbottom flask was charged with 8-chloro-6-(pyridin-4-yl)quinazolin-2-amine (EN01547-76-1; 3.09 g, 12.04 mmol), (R)-tert-butyl 1-(4-bromophenyl)ethylcarbamate (EN01547-74-1; 4.42 g, 14.72 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (114.4 mg, 2.1 mol % Pd), XantPhos (155.0 mg, 2.2 mol %), and Cs2CO3 (5.57 g, 17.10 mmol). The flask was evacuated and backfilled with N2 (3x), and then anhydrous dioxane (40 mL) was added. The mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for ~5 minutes and was then heated under N2 in a 100 Â°C oil bath.  After heating overnight, LC-MS showed complete conversion of the starting material to the desired product (trace N-phenylated product). A significant side product appeared to be present, derived from the starting aminoquinazoline that had undergone two Suzuki couplings in the previous step (see EN01547-76; MW=518.6). The reaction was allowed to cool and was partitioned between EtOAc and H2O. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc, and the combined organics were concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was purified by silica gel chromatography (Rf in EtOAc = 0.44) to give a yellow-orange solid.  2.92 g (51%) of solid was collected. A trace of EtOAc remained by NMR analysis despite being kept under high vacuum over the weekend.  B`^

The mixture was degassed by subjecting to vacuum then nitrogen atmosphere (six times). Palladium(II) acetate (0.063 g, 0.28 mmol) and 2,8,9-Triisobutyl-2,5,8,9-tetraaza-1-phosphabicyclo{3.3.3}undecane (0.200 mL, 0.56 mmol) was added and the mixture degassed again. The resulting suspension was stirred at 90 Â°C for 3 hours. Palladium(II) acetate (0.126 g, 0.56 mmol) and  2,8,9-Triisobutyl-2,5,8,9-tetraaza-1-phosphabicyclo{3.3.3}undecane (0.400 mL, 1.12 mmol) was added and the reaction stirred at 90 Â°C for 5 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with water (100 mL) then extracted with EtOAc (300 mL), and washed with saturated brine (100 mL). The aqueous was extracted with EtOAc ( 100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated to afford crude product. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography (330g column), elution gradient 0 to 10% EtOH in DCM (rising quickly to 5% then more slowly to 10%). Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford impure isopropyl 4-(5-methoxy-6-(2-methyl-6-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)pyridin-3-ylamino)pyrimidin-4-yloxy)piperidine-1-carboxylate, EN02029-80-P, as a yellow solid. The chromatography was repeated to give a slightly purer sample, EN02029-80-P2. This was triturated with Et2O (40 mL) to give a mobile solid which was filtered off and washed with Et2O (2 x 10 mL) then hexane (2 x 10 mL) to give a pale yellow solid, EN02029-80-solid 1. Analysis of this compound showed good purity so this mobile pale yellow solid was handed in as EN02029-80-01.  BXV

The reaction was degassed with vacuum / nitrogen (6 times) and 2,8,9-Triisobutyl-2,5,8,9-tetraaza-1-phosphabicyclo{3.3.3}undecane (0.238 mL, 0.67 mmol) and Palladium(II) acetate (0.075 g, 0.33 mmol) was added and the suspension was stirred at 90 Â°C for a further 2 hours. More 2,8,9-Triisobutyl-2,5,8,9-tetraaza-1-phosphabicyclo{3.3.3}undecane (0.238 mL, 0.67 mmol) and Palladium(II) acetate (0.075 g, 0.33 mmol) was added and the suspension was stirred at 90 Â°C for a further another 2 hours before being allowed to cool and stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction was worked up with water (50 mL) and diluted with EtOAc (400 mL), and washed sequentially with water (100 mL) and saturated brine (50 mL). The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated to afford crude product. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography (330g column), elution gradient 0 to 50% EtOAc in DCM (rising quickly to 20% then more slowly to 50%). The impure fractions were collected and combined and purified again in exactly the same way. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford isopropyl 4-(5-methyl-6-(2-methyl-6-(methylsulfonyl)pyridin-3-ylamino)pyrimidin-4-yloxy)piperidine-1-carboxylate, EN02029-72-solid-1, as a yellow solid. This solid was recrystallised from MeOH (~ 50 mL) and the resultant solid filtered off and washed with cold MeOH (2 x 5 mL), Et2O (2 x 5 mL) then isohexane (2 x 5 mL). The solid, EN02029-72-solid-2 was combined with the product from EN02029-67-01 and the whole sample was named EN02029-72-01 (8.39 g) and submitted to the collection.  BVT

The mixture was degassed with argon, the vessel fitted with a reflux condenser, and then placed in an oil bath heated to 110 Â°C with stirring for 16 h. The mixture was cooled to rt, pre-absorbed onto silca gel (~ 20 g) and purified on silica gel (80 g) using MeOH/DCM (1:3) as eluent to afford the title compound ~ 90 % pure. This material was then dissolved in DMSO and purified via reverse phase HPLC water/MECN (5->55%, 12 min) as eluent. The pure fractions were collected and converted to the corresponding HCl salt to afford N-((1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl)-3-(3-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-6-amine (125 mg, 49.5 %) hydrochloride as a white solid.

The reaction was heated to 120 Â°C for 10 minutes in the microwave reactor and cooled to RT.  **_Work-up*_**  The mixture was diluted with EtOAc and filtered through a short celite pad. The solution was then concentrated to dryness to give an orange viscous liquid (~4.7g).  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 10% EtOAc in isohexane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 4-(6-(benzyloxy)pyridin-2-yl)morpholine (2.350 g, 87 %) as a yellow oil.    B97

**_Procedure:_**  To a flask was added 1,3-Dichloro-4-iodobenzene (5.89 mL, 43.41 mmol), piperidin-4-ylmethanol (5 g, 43.41 mmol), cesium carbonate (28.3 g, 86.83 mmol), 18-Crown-6 (1.377 g, 5.21 mmol), rac-2,2'-Bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl (0.811 g, 1.30 mmol), and toluene (50 mL). The mixture was stirred under nitrogen and Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (0.398 g, 0.43 mmol) was added in one portion. The resultant yellow mixture was heated with oil bath temperature set at 125Â°C for 3 hours. LCMS shows desired product as well as other impurities. The reaction was cooled to room temperature. Ethyl acetate (2 x 200 mL) was added and the resultant mixture was extracted with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (200 mL). The organics were collected and dried over sodium sulfate. Ethyl acetate (100 mL) and hexanes (100 mL) were added to the crude and insoluble material filltered off. The filtrate was concentrated and chromatographed on silica gel (divided into 3 40 gram silica gel columns). The columns were eluted with hexanes up to ethyl acetate:hexanes (up to 100%). The desired product eluted between 40-60% ethyl acetate:hexanes. Clean fractions were combined from all columns and concentrated to give EN01972-36-1 (2.47 g, 21.87% yield) as an orange oil.  B64

**_Procedure:_**  To a flask was added 1,3-Dichloro-4-iodobenzene (5.89 mL, 43.41 mmol), piperidin-4-ylmethanol (5 g, 43.41 mmol), cesium carbonate (28.3 g, 86.83 mmol), 18-Crown-6 (1.377 g, 5.21 mmol), rac-2,2'-Bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl (0.811 g, 1.30 mmol), and toluene (50 mL). The mixture was stirred under nitrogen and Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (0.398 g, 0.43 mmol) was added in one portion. The resultant yellow mixture was heated with oil bath temperature set at 125Â°C for 3 hours. LCMS shows desired product as well as other impurities. The reaction was cooled to room temperature. Ethyl acetate (2 x 200 mL) was added and the resultant mixture was extracted with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (200 mL). The organics were collected and dried over sodium sulfate. The crude was placed in the freezer for several days.  The crude was dissolved in 10% methanol:dichloromethane (200 mL) and preabsorbed onto silica gel. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel eluting with hexanes up to ethyl acetate:hexanes (10%, 20%, 40%). Desired product eluted at 40% ethyl acetate:hexanes. Collected clean fractions and concentrated to give EN01972-57-1 (2.83 g, 25.06% yield) as an orange oil.  Put aside product due to shift in priorities of project.  B64

LCMS showed formation of more bis-arylation by-product than in _EN01775-08_ (DMA under micorwaves conditions). The crude was combined with EN01775-08-01 and poured onto a silicagel column. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography eluting with 0 to 5% methanol in ethyl acetate/DCM (1/1). The solvent was evaporated to dryness to afford a gummy film in the flask **(37mg: not that bad)**. it was scratched in diethyl ether (soluble) then after Et2O evaporation in a few drops of MeCN. A solid crashed out. The resulting solid was taken up into diethyl ether, collected by filtration and dried to afford 8-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-2-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1(2H)-one (19.00 mg, 33.7 %) as a white solid (a bit soluble in Et2O because some P1 remained in the Et2O filtrate).  **not the real yield**  BUS

Argon was let to bubble in the mixture for 5 minutes. The reaction was heated to 90 Â°C, over a period of 90 minutes. LCMS showed complete and pretty clean reaction. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature under stirring, diluted with dichloromethane and decalite speed + was added. The mixture was concentrated and the crude product was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with 0 to 5% methanol in ethyl acetate/DCM (1/1). The solvent was evaporated to dryness, a bit of diethyl ether was added in order to crystallised but it didn't work. So it was concentrated again to afford 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-N-methylbenzamide (50.0 mg, 94 %) as a brown dry film.  BOM

The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to rt, the insolubles were removed by filtration, washed with EtOAc and the filtrate was concentrated. (Insolubles~25g, which seemed to contain very little P1 by TLC and LCMS).  The crude product (24.5g) was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with 0 to 5% methanol in ethyl acetate (pure AcOEt to remove by- product coming from overreaction). The solvent was evaporated to dryness to afford a foam (12.5g) which was dissolved in dichloromethane (100ml). The resulting crystalline precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with dichloromethane. The filtrate was concentrated down, taken up into DCM and a second crop was collected by filtration, which was combined with the first batch and dried to a constant weight to afford 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-6-methoxy- N-methylbenzamide (11.51 g, 75.0 %) as a white crystalline solid.  The filtrate was concentrated to dryness, taken up into DCM and collected by filtration to give a second sample EN02972-35-02 (0.41 g, 0.944 mmol, 2.67 %).  BUS

Two runs using the same amount of starting material (2,6-dichloro-3-iodopyridine (274 mg, 1 mmol)) and the same conditions were started and carried out as described in the following.  BINAP (46.7 mg, 0.08 mmol) and Pd2(dba)3 (22.89 mg, 0.03 mmol) were given into a nitrogen charged reaction vessel and dissolved in dioxane (10ml). 2,6-dichloro-3-iodopyridine (274 mg, 1 mmol), aniline (0.457 ml, 5.00 mmol) and sodium tert-butoxide (144 mg, 1.50 mmol) were weight in another flask and flushed with nitrogen. The prepared ligand-Pd mixture was added and the reaction mixture was heated at 100Â°C over night. The reaction was monitored using TLC and LC/MS.  After the reaction was completed, the dioxane was evapurated and both reaction vessels containing the same reaction-mixture were combined. The crude was solved in DCM, filtered through a silica plug and it followed a water work up using sodium bicarbonate (5 %), brine and water. The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to yield a dark brown oil. NMR showed the desired product, as well as the bis-addition of aniline.  The crude product was purified by reverse-phase preparative HPLC. Column: Kromasil C8. Eluent: A: MeCN, B: H2O/MeCN/CH3COOH, 95/5/0.2. Gradient: The A fraction was increased from 30 % to 70 % over 40 minutes. Flow: 70 mL/min.  The relevant fractions (6-9) were concentrated and freeze dried to yield 220.3 mg (46%) a brown oil.  B86

A solution of tert-butyl methylcarbamate (341 mg, 2.60 mmol) in dioxane (17.300 ml) was added to a stirred mixture of 6-(2-morpholino-4-oxo-4H-chromen-8-yl)dibenzo[b,d]thiophen-2-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate (974 mg, 1.73 mmol), TRIS(DIBENZYLIDENEACETONE)DIPALLADIUM(0) (39.7 mg, 0.04 mmol), (9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthene-4,5-diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine) (50.2 mg, 0.09 mmol) and cesium carbonate (2261 mg, 6.94 mmol). The resulting mixture was stirred under nitrogen at 110 Â°C for 18 hours.  The reaction mixture was poured into water (100 mL) and EtOAc (100 mL). Methanol addition was required to aid separation of layers. **[would vac off dioxane in future]**. The aqueous was further extracted with EtOAc (2 x 50 mL) and DCM (50 mL), all with the aid of methanol for layer separation. The combined organics were washed with saturated brine solution (still formed emulsions), dried over MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure.  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 4% 7M NH3/MeOH in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford tert-butyl methyl(6-(2-morpholino-4-oxo-4H-chromen-8-yl)dibenzo[b,d]thiophen-2-yl)carbamate (630 mg, 66.9 %) as a yellow solid.  This was taken through to the next step at 85% pure, with no further purification.    Bb`

Tris(dibenzylidenacetone)dipalladium(0) (31 mg, 0.03 mmol) and 2'-(dicyclohexylphosphino)-N,N-dimethylbiphenyl-2-amine (27 mg, 0.07 mmol) were stirred in anhydrous toluene (3 mL) for 15 minutes under an argon (g) sparge. To the stirring soluntion was added the N-(4-bromo-2,6-dimethylphenyl)-2-cyclopentylacetamide (208 mg, 0.67 mmol) and morpholine (0.070 mL, 0.80 mmol) neat, followed by the potassium tert-butoxide (1M in THF) (0.94 mL, 0.94 mmol) via syringe. he mixture was then heated in a sealed vessel to 80 Â°C for 18hrs before cooling to ambint temperature. The mixture was filtered thru a 0.7uM GMF. The resultant crude solution was subject to flash chromatorgraphy (SiO2 \- 12 g; gradient elution: 100% hexanes for 1 minute then 0% - 85% EtOAc/Hexane over 14 minutes at 30 mL/min) via detection with UV light at 254nm. The appropriate fractions were then stirred over decolorizing carbon (Norit neutral), filtered thru Celite and concentrated to afford the 2-cyclopentyl-N-(2,6-dimethyl-4-morpholinophenyl)acetamide (47.0 mg, 22.17 %) as a white solid in 90% purity by 1H NMR (CDCl3), though TLC and LCMS reveal one peak. The resultant solid was subject to flash chromatorgraphy (basic alumina - 24 g; gradient elution: 5% EtOAc/Hexane for 1.5 minutes then 5% - 100% EtOAc/Hexane over 11 minutes at 30 mL/min) via detection with UV light at 254nm to afford 2-cyclopentyl-N-(2,6-dimethyl-4-morpholinophenyl)acetamide (28.0 mg, 13.21 %) again what appears to be ~80% purity by 1H NMR (CDCl3), though TLC and LCMS reveal one peak. Aliqout was provided to for SFC analysis wherein all conditions examined reveal only one peak (attached). 1H NMR analysis in DMSO reveals one cmpd.

The reaction was heated to 80 Â°C for 18 hours. the reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature and diluted with dcm (50 ml). This was washed with water (2 x 50 ml), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was dissolved in hydrochloric acid solution in methanol (4N, 20 ml) and stirred at room temprature overnight. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure.The crude product was purified by ion exchange chromatography, using an SCX column. The desired product was eluted from the column using 7M NH3/MeOH and pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford (R)-1-(4-(benzyloxy)-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-methylpiperazine (0.429 g, 40.3 %) as a yellow gum.

The analysis on crude 4-bromobenzofuran-2-carboxylate shows traces of non cyclized and non aromoatized by-products.  2010-03-10  16:38:11: To a 25 mL rounbottomed flask was added ethyl 4-bromobenzofuran-2-carboxylate (1 g; 3.72 mmol) and toluene (10 mL/g-bulk-LR; 10 mL). The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove traces of water. The procedure was repeated once more. and finally toluene (10 mL/g-bulk-LR; 10 mL). The system was inerted three times and stirred under nitrogen gas.  17:03:56: To the homogenous mixture was added 1-benzylpiperazine (1.3 eq; 0.852 g; 0.84 mL; 4.83 mmol), TRIS(DIBENZYLIDENEACETONE)DIPALLADIUM(0) (0.02 eq; 68 mg; 0.07 mmol), 2-(DI-T-BUTYLPHOSPHINO)BIPHENYL (0.06 eq; 67 mg; 0.22 mmol) and CESIUM CARBONATE (1.2 eq; 1.453 g; 4.46 mmol). The system was inerted three times and stirred under nitrogen gas.  17:07:37: The Tj was set to Tj=100 Â°C. The mixture was stirred under nitrogen gas over night.  2010-03-11  08:42:44: IPC1 (15 h) sample was gathered and diluted with methanol. The analysis (EN03690-35-001-A) showed only 16 % conversion.  **Results and conclusion:** The experiment was discarded due to poor conversion.    BHF

Only small amount of 2 SM left and more product being formed. So further Palladium(II) acetate (100mg), rac-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl (400mg) and cesium carbonate (3g) were added and the slurry was stirred at 100 Â°C for a further 6 hours. traces of SM left  The reaction mixture was filtered through PTFE, diluted with DCM (100 mL), and washed sequentially with water (100 mL) and saturated brine (100 mL).

The mixture was capped and flushed with argon. 1,2-dimethoxyethane (5 mL) was added and the mixture was run in a microwave for 60 minutes at 100Â°C. Very little product. Added 0.1 eq ligand and palladium acetate, flushed with argon and run in the microwave at 100Â°C for 60 min. No change. Seems as if the 2-chloropyrimidine is not very soluble in DME. Added 1.5 mL DMF and the reaction was run again in the microwave for 60 minutes. The reaction mixture was filtrated through Celite and washed with dichloromethane. The filtrate was concentrated and the crude product was purified by preparative chromatography. The productcontaining fractions were pooled, concentrated and the residue was partitioned between sat.

The mixture was capped and flushed with argon. 1,2-dimethoxyethane (2 mL) was added and the mixture was run in a microwave for 60 minutes at 100Â°C. Extremely little product was formed according to LCMS. Added 0.1 eq of Palladium acetate and 2-(Dicyclohexylphosphino)biphenyl and 1 eq Cesium carbonate and let run for another 60 min at 100Â°C in the microwave. According to LCMS ther is 13% startingmaterial oxazepine left. Added a small spatula of acetoxy(2'-(di-tert- butylphosphino)biphenyl-2-yl)palladium and 0.3 mL ethanol and let run for 30 minutes at 100Â°C. The reaction mixture was filtrated through celite and concentrated. The crude product was purified by silica flash chromatography using a gradient of metanol (+ 10%7M ammonia) in dichloromethane. Unreacted starting material 3-methoxy-4-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)aniline came out together with the product. Obtained 0.203 mg of impure product (at 254 nm 18% pure, at 220 nm 28% pure, at 290 nm 60% pure). Combined this with EN03597-98-001 and EN03597-99-001 at EN03597-97-001.  BSQ

Charged a round-bottom flask with a mixture of 3-methoxy-4-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)aniline (0.702 g, 3.45 mmol), (R)-2-chloro-6-methyl-8-phenyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropyrimido[5,4-f][1,4]oxazepine (1.0 g, 3.63 mmol), palladium (II) acetate (0.023 g, 0.10 mmol), rac-BINAP (0.108 g, 0.17 mmol), potassium carbonate (0.716 g, 5.18 mmol), and toluene (20 mL). The atmosphere s inerted through nitrogen purge cycles, then heated at 120 Â°C or 16 hours.  HPLC-UV shows the reaction is not as clean as in the microwave, and conversion is very poor. The contents were allowed to continue heating over the weekend, but although conversion improved, the mixture contained many impurities.

Solid was filtered and washed twice with CH2Cl2 to afford 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-5-fluoro- N-methoxybenzamide (7.1 g) as an off-white solid.  The filtrate was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with 10 to 100% ethyl acetate in dichloromethane ( _elution of impurities_ ) then with 5%, 10% and 15% MeOH in ethyl acetate ( _product elutes on TLC plate with 100% EtOAc but n MeOH to elute from the column probably due to poor solubility in EtOAc_ ). The solvent was evaporated to dryness. Residual oil was triturated in CH2Cl2. Resulting solid was filtered nad dried to afford 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-5-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-N,6-dimethoxybenzamide (0.9 g) as an off-white solid.  Both batches (8g) were combined and recrystallised from EtOH (70 mL) to afford 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-5-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-N,6-dimethoxybenzamide (3.6 g) as a white crystalline solid => _less hot EtOH ( <60 mL ?) could have been used to solubilise all._  Filtrate was concentrated to ~half the volume and then stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. The resulting solid was filtered to afford 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-5-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-N,6-dimethoxybenzamide (3.2 g) as a white solid.  Both batches of solid (6.8 g) were combined and slurried in EtOAc (65 mL) at room temperature for 24 hours. The resulting solid was filtered and dried at 50Â°C under high vacuum overnight to afford 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-5-fluoro- N-methoxybenzamide (4.52g, 54%, EN03787-13-01) as a white solid.  Filtrate was concentrated to ~20 mL and then stirred at room temperature 24 hours. The resulting solid was filtered and dried under high vacuum at 50Â°C overnight to afford 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-5-fluoro- N-methoxybenzamide (1.12g, 13.4%, EN03787-13-02) as a white solid.

LCMS analysis showed a new peak for product (9%) but both SM's still remained (pyridine 71%, benzamide 13 %). Another 1.1 eq of benzamide (60 mg in 2ml dioxane) was added and the RM was then heated at 95 Â°C overnight. Lcms after this time showed no further progression with the reaction. Therefore a further portion of palladium acetate (0.05 eq. 3.32 mg) and the xanthene ligand (0.1 eq. 17.14 mg) were added and the RM stirred o/n at 95Â°C. Analysis after this time showed a majority peak for product and no pyridine SM remaining. The RM was concentrated and dry loaded onto silica. It was then purified on a 12g isco column using initially 0-100 % ethyl acetate in DCM followed by 0-10 % methanol in ethyl acetate to give 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-5-fluoro- N-methoxybenzamide (60.0 mg, 46.2 %) which was not very pure  Trituration with diethyl ether did not produce a purer product.

The reaction mixture was then stirred at 90 Â°C for 4 hours and cooled to RT. LCMS analysis showed a new peak for product but both SM's still remained. The RM was then heated at 100 Â°C for a further 4 hours, after this time LCMS analysis showed none of the pyridine SM remaining and a bigger peak for product. The RM was concentrated and then dissolved in methanol and dry loaded onto silica. The crude was purified on a 12g Si column eluting with 0-10 % methanol in DCM. Fractions 3-8 and 18-28 contained product and were combined. LCMS analysis/TLC showed that the product was still not pure.  Diethyl ether trituration gave 2-(2-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-5-ylamino)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylamino)-N,6-dimethoxybenzamide (235 mg, 56.9 %) as a pure product.  BXV

The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 3% methanolic ammmonia  (7 M) in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford P1 as a brown solid. The product was further purified by crystallisation from hot DCM/MeOH to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)-4,5-dimethyloxazol-2-amine (34.0 mg, 15.20 %) as a beige solid.  Conclusion: A relatively low yield of the desired product was isolated here, it may be possible to increase the above yield at higher temperature or by using excess amine as electron rich oxazoles are prone to decomposition.

Objective: To find out which substrates are efficient coupling partners, is there a robust link between how electron poor the substrate is and yield i.e. more electron poor aminooxazoles produce greater yields.  Pd2(dba)3 (22.89 mg, 0.025 mmol), 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (43.4 mg, 0.075 mmol), 2,4-dichloropyridine (148 mg, 1.00 mmol), cesium carbonate (652 mg, 2.00 mmol) and 4,5-dimethyloxazol-2-amine (112 mg, 1.00 mmol) were added to an oven dried microwave vial, the vial was capped and placed under an inert atmosphere, dioxane (4 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was heated to 140 Â°C for 1 h by microwave irradiation under a nitrogen atmosphere.  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 30% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)-4,5-dimethyloxazol-2-amine (34.0 mg, 15.20 %) as a pale yellow solid.  Conclusion: The dimethyl substituted 2-aminooxazole (relatively electron rich) produces more coupled product than the unsubstituted 2-aminooxazole. Of the 2-aminooxazoles tested thus far the 4- and 5-ester substituted aminooxazoles are the most efficient coupling partners.  Note: A run at T= 160 Â°C may be beneficial, an increase in yield was seen for the ester substituted 2-aminooxazole under these more forcing conditions.  B64

Methanol was added to the crude reaction mixture together with silica (2 g), the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the remaining residue was placed in dry load tube prior to chromatography. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 100% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)oxazol-2-amine (1.000 mg, 0.503 %) as a beige solid.  Conclusion: Trace amount of the desired product isolated.  B0.

  C   A*’JObjective: To find out which substrates are efficient coupling partners, is there a robust link between how electron poor the substrate is and yield i.e. more electron poor aminooxazoles produce greater yields.  Pd2(dba)3 (22.89 mg, 0.025 mmol), 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (43.4 mg, 0.075 mmol), 2,4-dichloropyridine (148 mg, 1.00 mmol), cesium carbonate (652 mg, 2.00 mmol) and 4-methyloxazol-2-amine (98 mg, 1.00 mmol) were added to an oven dried microwave vial, the vial was capped and placed under an inert atmosphere, dioxane (4 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was heated to 140 Â°C for 1 h by microwave irradiation under a nitrogen atmosphere.  Dichloromethane (10 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture and the mixture was adsorbed onto silica gel. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 30% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)-4-methyloxazol-2-amine (59.0 mg, 28.1 %) as a cream solid.  Note: a further 34 mg of impure product came off the column early and so the yield for this reaction is probably closer to 35% had the purification been efficient.  Conclusion: Somewhat surprisingly the methyl substituted amino-oxazole gave significant amounts of coupled product. It appears that certain moderately elctron rich substrates may also undergo relatively efficient coupling.  B31

The vial was then capped and purged with nitrogen and anisole (1 mL) was added. The solution was stirred at 50Â°C for 40 mins, then 90Â°C for 15 mins (activated catalyst solution, Soln. 1).  To another oven-dried microwave vial was added potassium carbonate (126 mg, 0.91 mmol), ethyl 2-aminooxazole-5-carboxylate (190 mg, 1.22 mmol) and 2,4-dichloropyridine (90 mg, 0.61 mmol) and the vial was capped and purged with nitrogen. anisole (1.35 mL) and the activated catalyst solution (0.45 mL Soln. 1 from above) were added (this corresponds to a catalyst loading of 10% Pd) and the vessel was heated to 90 Â°C for 16 h.  LCMS of the crude reaction mixture showed the presence of a significant amount of amine starting material (Rt=0.95 min) as well as some 2,4-dichloropyridine starting material (Rt=1.75 min) together with a small amount of the desired product (Rt= 2.08). The mass corresponding to the double addition product was not observed.  Conclusion: Reaction produced a small amount of the desired product but mainly starting material remained.  B:8

The vial was then capped, purged with nitrogen and anisole (1 mL) (degassed) was added. The solution was stirred at 50Â°C for 40 mins, then 90Â°C for 15 mins (activated catalyst solution, Soln. 1).  To another oven-dried microwave vial was added potassium carbonate (126 mg, 0.91 mmol), ethyl 2-aminooxazole-5-carboxylate (190 mg, 1.22 mmol) and 2,4-dichloropyridine (90 mg, 0.61 mmol) and the vial was capped and purged with nitrogen. anisole (1.6 mL) and the activated catalyst solution (0.45 mL of Soln. 1 from above) were added (this corresponds to a catalyst loading of 10% Pd). The vessel was then heated to 120Â°C for 16 h. LCMS and TLC of the crude reaction mixture showed none of the desired product to be present. Some of the amine starting material appears to be present and none of the 2,4-dichloropyridine remains. The mass for the double addition product (addition at the 2- and 4-positions) is present, but co-elutes with the reaction solvent anisole and is not quantifiable as a result.  Conclusion: This is a somewhat surprising result, based on the fact that the previous reaction (EN05378-17) results in the formation of significant coupled product. These reaction conditions are apparently not suitable for the coupling of the ester substituted 2-aminooxazole.  B:8

   C   A*ÎJËObjective: Peparation of the above coupled product on a larger scale for hydrolysis-protodecarboxylation study.  To an oven-dried microwave vial was added ethyl 2-aminooxazole-5-carboxylate (546 mg, 3.50 mmol), 2,4-dichloropyridine (0.378 mL, 3.50 mmol), cesium carbonate (2279 mg, 6.99 mmol), TRIS(DIBENZYLIDENEACETONE)DIPALLADIUM(0) (80 mg, 0.09 mmol) and (9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthene-4,5-diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine) (152 mg, 0.26 mmol) and the vial was capped and purged with nitrogen. dioxane (18 mL) (degassed) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 160 Â°C for 1 h under microwave irradiation.  LCMS of the crude reaction mixture shows the required product to be the major product together with an isomer of the same mass (Rt= 1.91), the ratio of the desired product to this isomeric product being circa 5:1. LCMS also shows that a small amount of the 2-aminooxazole ester starting material remains (Rt= 0.99 min) and so the reaction with this particular substrate may benefit from slightly longer reaction times, maybe 90 mins. A small amount of the coupled and decarboxylated product was also present (Rt= 1.68 min).  Saturated ammonium chloride (15 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture and the mixture was transfrred to a separating funnel. Ethyl acetate (80 mL) was then added and the organic layer was separated (keeping the interfacial material with the organic layer). The aqueous layer was washed with ethyl acetate (2 x 80 mL portions). (Note: During this extraction, a solid, presumably the required product was seen to crash out in the organic layer. If this reaction is to be repeated a work-up free approach is recommended where the crude reaction mixture is dry-loaded directly onto silica for chromatographic purification). The solvent was removed from the combined organics under reduced pressure. The crude product was loaded onto a pre- wetted silica column using the minimum DCM and methanol.  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 100% DCM (5% methanolic ammonia) in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 744 mg of impure product.  The crude residue was triturated with Et2O to give a solid which was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (415 mg, 44.3 %) as a beige solid.    Conclusion: The desired product was isolated in moderate yield and high purity (95% based on strength NMR). The moderate yield may be improved under a longer reaction time, it is also probable that purification difficulties were also detrimental to the yield of this reaction.  B:8

Reaction (a): Control reaction under identical conditions to EN04881-40 (should produce similar yield)  Reaction (b): As for control but spiked with 2 eq. of 2-aminooxazole with respect to catalyst, before dioxane was added (will produce decreased yield if 2-aminooxazole is a poison)  Reaction (c): As for control but spiked with 1 eq. of N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)oxazol-2-amine, before dioxane was added (will produce decreased yield if N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)oxazol-2-amine is a poison)  Pd2(dba)3 (22.89 mg, 0.025 mmol), 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (43.4 mg, 0.075 mmol), 2,4-dichloropyridine (148 mg, 1.00 mmol), cesium carbonate (651 mg, 2.00 mmol),ethyl 2-aminooxazole-5-carboxylate (156 mg, 1.00 mmol) and 4,4'-di-tert- butylbiphenyl (26.6 mg, 0.10 mmol) were added to an oven dried microwave vial, the vial was capped and placed under an inert atmosphere. Dioxane (4 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was heated to 140 Â°C for 1 h by microwave irradiation under a nitrogen atmosphere.    An isolated yield was obtained for reaction (a). Dichloromethane (10 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture and the mixture was adsorbed onto silica. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 20% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (111 mg, 41.5 %) as a white solid.  Taking into account that the crude LCMS for reaction (A) corresponds to a ~ 42% isolated yield, the amount of product can be calculated for reactions (B) and (C) using the ratio between the t-Butyl biphenyl and the required product in the LCMS. The amount of required product produced in reaction (B) was 41% and for reaction (C) 45% product was produced.  Conclusion: The above compounds do not poison the catalyst.  Note: Significant amounts of what is assumed to be the regioisomeric 4-aminated product were also formed in these reactions. Major regioisomer formed in ~ 4:1 ratio.  B:8

  C   A*öJóObjective: To find out if the regioisomeric ester is also a reaction substrate in this C-N bond forming reaction  Pd2(dba)3 (22.89 mg, 0.025 mmol), 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (43.4 mg, 0.075 mmol), 2,4-dichloropyridine (148 mg, 1.00 mmol), cesium carbonate (651 mg, 2.00 mmol),ethyl 2-aminooxazole-5-carboxylate (156 mg, 1.00 mmol) were added to an oven dried microwave vial, the vial was capped and placed under an inert atmosphere, dioxane (4 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was heated at 140 Â°C for 1 h by microwave irradiation under a nitrogen atmosphere.  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 30% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (135 mg, 50.5 %) as a white solid.    Conclusion: The desired product was isolated in > 50% isolated yield. The electron withdrawing ester group again has a positive effect on this reaction. More work needs to be carried out to probe the origin of this effect. NOESY confirmed expected regioisomer was formed (see sample details).  B:8

The regioisomeric ratio is 2.8:1 and although the product was not formed in synthetically useful yields, it is an interesting result.  Conclusion: Switch in regioselectivty with the change in ligand may be worth pursuing.  B:8

Objective: Isolate a larger quantity of product for hydrolysis/decarboxylation study  Pd2(dba)3 (91 mg, 0.10 mmol), 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (173 mg, 0.30 mmol), 2,4-dichloropyridine (591 mg, 4.00 mmol), cesium carbonate (2604 mg, 7.99 mmol) and ethyl 2-aminooxazole-5-carboxylate (624 mg, 4.00 mmol) were added to an oven dried microwave vial. The vial was capped and placed under an inert atmosphere, dioxane (16 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was heated at 160 Â°C for 1 h by microwave irradiation under a nitrogen atmosphere.  This reaction was run in four portions, i.e. four identical microwave reactions were carried out on 1/4 of the above scale. The reactions were then combined and purified as a single sample.  Purification by chromatography on silica using heptane:ethyl acetate as eluent, on alumina with heptane:ethyl acetate and via reverse phase on C18 silica failed. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 3% Methanolic ammonia (7 M) in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (534 mg, 49.9 %) as a pale yellow solid.  Althought the LCMS looks good for the fractions combined for this sample, the proton NMR shows significant impurities to be present.  Conclusion: Sufficient material isolated for hydrolysis/decarboxylation study.  B:8

To an oven-dried microwave vial was added ethyl 2-aminooxazole-5-carboxylate (156 mg, 1.00 mmol), 2,4-dichloropyridine (0.108 mL, 1.00 mmol), cesium carbonate (651 mg, 2.00 mmol), TRIS(DIBENZYLIDENEACETONE)DIPALLADIUM(0) (22.87 mg, 0.02 mmol) and bis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)(2',4',6'-triisopropyl-3,6-dimethoxybiphenyl-2-yl)phosphine (80 mg, 0.10 mmol) and the vial was capped and purged with nitrogen. dioxane (4 mL) (degassed) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 160 Â°C for  1 h under microwave irradiation. The reaction mixture was heated to 160Â°C for a further 3 h due to incomplete conversion.  DCM (10 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture together with silica (2 g). The solvent was then removed from the reaction mixture under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was then added tom a dry-load tube prior to chromatography.  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 2.5% methanolic ammonia (7 M) in DCM. The desired product (4-substitution) was isolated as a mixture with the 2-substituted product. The ratio of the 2-isomer to the 4-isomer is 2.4:1 for the mxture with no other fractions containing either isomer.  Conclusion: The apparent higher selectivity for the 4-isomer is due to the overlap of the 2,4-dichloropyridine starting material with this isomer. Therefore this reaction actually forms the 2-isomer selectively and is not a very active catalyst for this transformation.  B:8

To an oven-dried round bottomed flask was added ethyl 2-aminooxazole-5-carboxylate (156 mg, 1.00 mmol), cesium carbonate (651 mg, 2.00 mmol), TRIS(DIBENZYLIDENEACETONE)DIPALLADIUM(0) (22.87 mg, 0.02 mmol), (9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthene-4,5-diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine) (43.4 mg, 0.07 mmol) and 2,4-dichloropyridine (0.108 mL, 1.00 mmol). A reflux condenser was fitted and the vessel was purged with nitrogen. dioxane (2 mL)/DMSO (2 mL) (degassed) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 100 Â°C for 16 h.  The crude product was purified by ion exchange chromatography, using an SCX column. The desired product was eluted from the column using 7M NH3/MeOH and pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford the crude product.  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 1 to 3% methanolic ammonia (7 M) in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (128 mg, 47.9 %) as a pale yellow solid.  Conclusion: The desired product was formed in moderate yield.  Normal-phase column DCM:methanolic ammonia  B:8

  ðB   A*¯J¬Objective: Repeat of optimised conditions found in process research and devellopment screen for an isolated yield.  An activated catalyst solution was prepared by adding TRIS(DIBENZYLIDENEACETONE)DIPALLADIUM(0) (61.3 mg, 0.07 mmol) and (9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthene-4,5-diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine) (77 mg, 0.13 mmol) to an oven-dried microwave vial. The vial was then capped and purged with nitrogen and anisole (1 mL) (degassed) was added. The solution was stirred at 50Â°C for 40 mins, then 90Â°C for 15 mins (activated catalyst solution; Soln. 1).  To another oven-dried microwave vial was added potassium carbonate (126 mg, 0.91 mmol), oxazol-2-amine (102 mg, 1.22 mmol) and 2,4-dichloropyridine (90 mg, 0.61 mmol) and the vial was capped and purged with nitrogen. anisole (1.35 mL) and the activated catalyst solution (0.45 mL of Soln. 1 from above) were then added (this corresponds to a catalyst loading of 10% Pd). The vessel was then heated to 120 Â°C for 16 h. LCMS of the crude reaction mixture indicated that the desired product was present (Rt= 1.70) along with a trace amount of the double addition product i.e. amine addition at the 2- and 4-position (Rt= 1.22 min).  The reaction mixture was quenched with saturated ammonium chloride (8 mL) and transferred to a separating funnel. Ethyl acetate (15 mL) was then added and the organic layer was separated (keeping the interfacial material with the organic layer). The aqueous layer was washed with ethyl acetate (2 x 15 mL portions). The combined organics were then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. DCM (1 mL) was then added to the resulting residue (which still contained anisole (4 mL)) and this solution was loaded directly onto a silica column (40 g).  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 30% DCM (5% methanolic ammonia) in DCM, then 100% DCM (5% methanolic ammonia). Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)oxazol-2-amine (59.0 mg, 49.6 %) as an off-white solid. Note: This product was only 52% pure based on NMR strength.  Conclusion: The desired product was isolated but in relatively low yield and low purity.  B0.

  C   A*½	Jº	Objective: To isolate some of the required product to provide an analytical sample for a large catalyst screen.  2,4-dichloropyridine (0.109 mL, 1.01 mmol), oxazol-2-amine (85 mg, 1.01 mmol), TRIS(DIBENZYLIDENEACETONE)DIPALLADIUM(0) (22.89 mg, 0.02 mmol), (9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthene-4,5-diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine) (44.0 mg, 0.08 mmol) (Xantphos) and cesium carbonate (660 mg, 2.03 mmol) were added to a microwave vail and the vial was purged with nitrogen. Degassed dioxane (4 mL) was then added and the reaction mixture was heated to 140 Â°C for 1 h under microwave irradiation.  LCMS of crude reaction mixture showed some of the required product was formed, however the LCMS using acidic modifier was somewhat misleading as a side- product co-elutes with the required product thus giving the impression that a greater amount of product was formed than is the case. LCMS under acidic modifier is more informative.  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 20% heptane in EtOAc. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)oxazol-2-amine (4.00 mg, 2.018 %) as a pale yellow residue.  Conclusion: 4 mg of impure product was isolated.  B0.

Jÿ	Objective: If deprotonation is rate-determining in this coupling quantitative deprotonation prior to subjection to coupling conditions should prove beneficial.  To an oven dried microwave vial was added oxazol-2-amine (85 mg, 1.01 mmol) together with sodium hydride (40.5 mg, 1.01 mmol), the vial was capped and purged with nitrogen and dioxane (1 mL) was added. The mixture was then stirred at rt for 1 h (initially effervescence was observed but subsided within 20 min of stirring).  To the above vial was added 2,4-dichloropyridine (0.109 mL, 1.01 mmol), TRIS(DIBENZYLIDENEACETONE)DIPALLADIUM(0) (22.89 mg, 0.02 mmol) and (9,9-dimethyl-9H-xanthene-4,5-diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine) (44.0 mg, 0.08 mmol) (Xantphos) as a solution in dioxane (2 mL) and the reaction mixture was heated to 140 Â°C for 1 h under microwave irradiation.  Dichloromethane (10 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture and the mixture was absorbed onto silica. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 20% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)oxazol-2-amine (6.00 mg, 3.03 %) as a pale yellow dry film.  Conclusion: The formal deprotonation appears to have had no benificial effect on this coupling.  B0.

Degassed dioxane (4mL) was then added and the reaction mixture was heated to 160 Â°C for 6 h under microwave irradiation.  Dichloromethane (10 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture and the mixture was adsorbed onto silica gel. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 20% EtOAc in heptane. Unfortunately and somewhat surprisingly, none of the desired product was isolated, although only a trace of required product was observed in the LCMS of the crude reaction mixture.  Conclusion: It appears that under this higher catalyst loading the reaction is less efficent, potentially a concentration effect?  B0.

To this solution was added oxazol-2-amine (94 mg, 1.11 mmol) and the reaction mixture was heated to 130 Â°C for 30 min under microwave irradiation.  **Apparently no 2-aminooxazole remains by proton NMR of crude reaction mixture upon removal of dioxane, however it's presence was observed by LCMS of the crude reaction mixture (see attached). It is possible that the presence of impurities/solvent etc. have shifted the resonances slightly for this starting material in** **1** **H NMR.**  The crude product was purified by reverse-phase flash chromatography on C-18 modified silica, elution gradient 0 to 100% MeCN in water. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)oxazol-2-amine (6.00 mg, 3.03 %) as a pale yellow dry film.  3 % of the required product was isolated and this sample was impure. Microwave heating has no positive effect under these reaction conditions.  Upon submission of a crude sample of the reaction mixture to  both starting materials were observed.  Conclusion: 3% of impure material isolated, look for alternative conditions.  B0.

Palladium(II) acetate (11.38 mg, 0.05 mmol) was added in a single portion to a degassed solution of 9,9-dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (44.0 mg, 0.08 mmol), oxazol-2-amine (85 mg, 1.01 mmol), cesium carbonate (768 mg, 2.36 mmol),2,4-dichloropyridine (0.109 mL, 1.01 mmol), dioxane (4 mL) and DMSO (0.8 mL) and the resulting mixture was heated at 100 Â°C for 16 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere.  Note: the reaction mixture was degassed by first combing the reagents (with the exception of Pd((OAc)2), sealing the vessel and carrying out three pump- purge cycles (vac-nitrogen). Dioxane was then added to this mixture via syringe, followed by the Pd(OAc)2 in a single portion and the vessel was heated for the required time as above. Solvent boiled dry from reaction overnight. Only DMSO remained. **Crude proton NMR shows mainly dichlorpyridine starting material and the 2-aminooxazole starting material was absent**. Crude LCMS indicates that a product of the required mass is present.  The crude product was purified by flash chromatography on C-18 modified silica, elution gradient 0 to 100% MeCN in water with basic modifier (1% ammonium hydroxide). Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)oxazol-2-amine (22.00 mg, 11.10 %) as a pale yellow residue.  The product isolated, although impure, looks like the required product based on LCMS. The 1H NMR of the purified material is in D6-DMSO here and so not directly comparable with previous spectra in CDCl3.  Conclusion: This may be worth pursuing (i.e. adding DMSO to aid solubility) based on the slightly increased yield.  **Revision: Required product not isolated, spectral analysis of isolated sample does not match those of authentic samples of the coupled product**  .

The crude product was purified by reverse-phase flash chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 100% MeCN in water. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford ethyl 2-(4-chloropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-4-carboxylate (99 mg, 37.0 %) as a pale yellow solid.  Conclusion: Yield produced under microwave conditions is essentially identical to overnight reaction with conventional heating. Therefore screening of other aminooxazoles can be carried out under microwave conditions in the interest of time.  .  B:8

The reaction mixture was flushed with nitrogen and the mixture was heated to 100Â°C and stirred overnight. The reaction was complete. The solids were filtered off and washed with ethyl acetate. The organic solution was extracted by sat NaHCO3 solution. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using DCM : [DCM:MeOH:NH3=90:10:1] = 100:0 to 60:40 as gradient. The product was obtained as yellow foam 766 mg purity 95-99% depending on wavelength (95% on 220nm). The compound was dissolved in DCM and treated with activated carbon, then filtered and concentrated. The purity was **not** increased by the treatment!  Preparative purification with Gilson prep was performed, 30-70% gradient was used. The material was collected manually. The fractions were pooled together, concentrated in vacuo then treated with DCM and sat NaHCO3 solution. The phases were separated, the organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The product was obtained as white foam and was dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 40Â°C.    B][

The reaction mixture was flushed with nitrogen and the mixture was heated to 100Â°C and stirred overnight. The reaction was completed. The solids were filtered off and washed with DCM. The organic solution was extracted by sat NaHCO3 solution. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography using DCM : [DCM:MeOH:NH3=90:10:1] = 100:0 to 60:40 as gradient. The product was obtained as yellow foam 1.55 g with a purity 96-99% depending on wavelength (96% on 220nm). Preparative purification with Gilson prep was performed, 30-70% gradient was used. The material was collected manually. The fractions were pooled together, concentrated in vacuo then treated with DCM and sat NaHCO3 solution. The phases were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM 2 more times than once with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The product was obtained as white foam and was dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 50Â°C. According to 1H-NMR 1.5 % ethyl acetate was present in the sample.  **Ethyl acetate should be avoided for extraction!** The sample was dissolved in DCM and concentrated in vacuo then the process was repeated 2 more times. The product was dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 50Â°C.    B][

The atmosphere was exchanged to nitrogen through consecutive vacuum- nitrogen purge cycles after which the mixture was heated at 120 Â°C for 16 h. Still some starting material left according to HPLC and LCMS (IPC 1), so another 25 mg of Pd(OAc)2 and 116 mg of BINAP was added, and heating continued. After another 4 h, no further progress was detected (IPC 2), so the mixture was allowed to cool to r.t.  Dichloromethane (200 mL) was added and pH was adjusted to 2 by addition of 2M HCl (aq) (80 mL was added, but made too acidic). The phases were separated and the aq phase was made basic by addition of 1M NaOH (aq) (ca 70 mL). The aq phase was extracted with dichloromethane (200 mL) and re-extracted with another portion of dichloromethane (70 mL). Since the aq phase still contained some product, another portion of 1M NaOH (aq) (20 mL) was added and the aq phase was extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL). The combined organic layers were evaporated and toluene was added to co-evaporate water. The resulting brown solid was dried under vacuum o.n, yielding EN04391-37-001 (12 g, 27.1 mmol, 117 %).  To the solid was added EtOAc (55 mL) and the slurry was stirred at r.t for 1 h. Stirring was turned off and the solid was allowed to sediment for 2 h. The solid was filtered off and washed with 2x 12 mL cold EtOAc, yielding EN04391-37-002 (5.7 g, 12.88 mmol, 55.7 %).  The mother liquor still contained product so it was concentrated and to the residue was added isopropanol (18 mL, 2 mL/ g crude). The mixture was heated to dissolve everything (50 Â°C for 5 min) and was then stirred at r.t over night. A white precipitate had formed. The mixture was cooled on an ice bath (0-5 Â°C) for 1 h after which the solid was filtered off, washed with 2x10 mL cold isopropanol and dried at 40 Â°C under vacuum, yielding EN04391-37-003 (2.3 g, 5.20 mmol, 22.49 %).  EN04391-37-002 and EN04391-37-003 were combined with EN04391-36-002 and EN04391-36-003 and further purified, see page EN04391-38.  B][

The atmosphere was exchanged to nitrogen through consecutive vacuum- nitrogen purge cycles after which the mixture was heated at 120 Â°C for 18 h. Still some starting material left according to HPLC and LCMS (IPC 1), so another 25 mg of Pd(OAc)2 and 116 mg of BINAP was added, and heating continued. After another 3 h, approx. 2% starting material remained according to LCMS (IPC 2), so the mixture was allowed to cool to r.t. Dichloromethane (200 mL) was added and pH was adjusted to 2 by addition of 2M HCl (aq) (140 mL was added, but made too acidic). The phases were separated and the aq phase was made basic by addition of 1M NaOH (aq) (ca 200 mL). The aq phase was extracted with dichloromethane (200 mL) and re-extracted with another portion of dichloromethane (70 mL). Since an oily residue containing product had precipitated upon addition of acid/ base, the aq phase together with 100 mL dichloromethane was added to the residue in an attempt to dissolve it. More 1M NaOH (aq) was added to assure basic pH and the layers were separated. The combined organic layers were evaporated and the residue was dried under vacuum o.n. EN04391-36-001 (12.2 g, 27.6 mmol, 109 %) was obtained as a brown solid.  To the solid was added isopropanol (48 mL, 4 mL/g crude prod) and the thick suspension was heated at 95 Â°C. After 30 min, the slurry was allowed to cool to r.t and left stirring over night. The still thick slurry was cooled on an ice bath at 0-5 Â°C for 1 h before it was filtered. The solid was washed with 4x15 mL of cold isopropanol and dried at 40 Â°C under vacuum o.n, yielding EN04391-36-002 (2.05 g, 4.63 mmol, 18.38 %) as a pale yellow solid  The mother liquor that still contained product was concentrated. An orange- brown foam was obtained. Toluene was added and evaporated and the residue (8 g) was dissolved in MeCN (13.5 mL) and purified by chromatography (200 g SiO2 in a filter funnel, elutent: EtOAc (750 mL) followed by MeCN (1 L) and MeCN:MeOH 9:1 (1 L)). Fractions 10-13 were combined, concentrated and dried, yielding EN04391-36-003 (5.5 g, 12.43 mmol, 49.3 %) as a solid. EN04391-36-002 and EN04391-36-003 were further purified on page EN04391-38.

Aniline (Acros; 1.20 mL, 13.2 mmol) was added followed by additional toluene (30 mL), and the mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 5 minutes before being placed in a 100 Â°C oil bath.  After heating overnight, the reaction was allowed to cool and was partitioned between EtOAc and water. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (2x), and the combined organics were concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was purified by silica gel chromatography (gradient elution; Rf in 90:10 hexanes:EtOAc = 0.54) to give a red-orange solid. 1.89 g of solid was collected.  B<:

The mixture was warmed at 120 Â°C for 1h  and ~65% conversion was observed on NMR*(see attached NMR). Reaction seems to work fine and assumed better yield than in 4773-50.

The resulting suspension was degased with argon and then stirred at 100 Â°C for 16 hours.  The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, concentrated in presence of silica gel and purified by Chromatography on silica gel (Novasep) eluting with 0 to 10% methanol in ethyl acetate. The solvent was evaporated to dryness to afford methyl 8-(1-(3,5-difluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)-2-morpholino-4-oxo-4H-chromene-6-carboxylate (10.30 g, 56.0 %) as an yellow foam.  BXV

Chem. 2009, page 3846-3854 (changed: solvent to dioxane and bromide to iodide)._**  The indole from 4773-41, 1-(benzyloxy)-3-iodobenzene, Pd2(dba)3, JohnPhos and KOtBu were dissolved in toluene. The mixture was warmed at 120 Â°C for 1h  and ~40% conversion was observed on NMR. The reaction mixture was further heated at 80 Â°C for 16h and 40 h, see attached 1H-NMR for reaction progress. A comparison with 4773-51 shows that using dioxane or iodide gives a lower yield (slower reaction). Switching the solvent to toluene was explored in 4773-52. The reaction in this experiment showed that the Buchwald conditions worked. Reaction mixture was thrown away.  BPN

The resulting suspension was stirred at 100 Â°C for 16 hours then cooled to room temperature. LCMS analysis indicates no SM, product peak present. The reaction mixture was concentrated _in vacuo_. The residue was dissolved in DCM (100 mL) and washed with water (100 mL). The organic layer was passed through phase separating cartridge and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 10% MeOH in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford a yellow gum. The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC (Waters XBridge Prep C18 OBD column, 5Âµ silica, 19 mm diameter, 100 mm length), using decreasingly polar mixtures of water (containing 1% NH3) and MeCN as eluents. Fractions containing the desired compound were evaporated to dryness to afford (R)-6-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)-N-(5-((1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl)methoxy)pyridin-2-yl)pyrimidin-4-amine (39.0 mg, 14.09 %) as an pale yellow solid.  Experiment was re-opened on 08/06/2012 to record additional data for publication. 13C and HRMS data recorded as separate sections rather than within sample details due to ELN conflict when trying to sign and close with redundant project code.

The reaction mixure was heated at 70 oC for 3 hours. The reaction was concentrated, partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The aqueous phase was extracted 3 times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. The crude material was loaded on a 40g silica gel column and purified on a Teledyne Isco instrument, eluting with 20% to 70% ethyl acetate in heptane to provide N-(1-phenylethyl)pyrazin-2-amine (148 mg, 42.5 %) as a solid.

The flask was evacuated and back-filled with nitrogen and the resulting mixture was stirred at 60 Â°C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 days. LCMS shows 10% conversion. Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (0.183 g, 0.20 mmol) and 2-Dicyclohexylphosphino-2',6'-diisopropoxybiphenyl (0.187 g, 0.40 mmol) (RuPhos) were added and the mixture was heated to 80 Â°C and stirred for 5 h. LCMS shows complete conversion. When cooled to rt the mixture was diluted with EtOAc (25 mL) and stirred for 1 h. The solid was filtered off and washed with EtOAc (50 mL). The filtrate was washed with saturated aqueous Na2CO3 (20 mL), brine (20 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. The crude producr was purified on a silica gel column eluted with 20-100% EtOAc in Heptane to give a yellow solid; tert-butyl 4-(2-methyl-3-oxoisoindolin-5-yl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (1.890 g, 57.0 %).

The vial was flushed with N2 and sealed and the mix was strd at rt.  Vial b: As above, but in PhCF3.  1100:start  2011-05-19  0800: LC/MS: around 50% r1 in both vials.  vial a: new peak at 1.53 min (20%), at 2.90 min (17%) and some small peaks as well.  vial b: new peak at 1.54 min (32%), 2.61 min (25%) and at 2.90 min (5%) and some small peaks as well.  MW/100 degr/20 min.  LC/MS, pH3:  vial a: 1.17 min: new peak (8-9%, not integrated); 2.11 min: new peak (31%), no right mass track.  vial b: 1.17 min: new, small peak; 2.11 min: new peak (17%), no right mass track.  The peak from the 2.11 peak is relatively higher in vial a than in b.  ACS calculation: r1 has logD 3.60, product has logD 1.92.  Any Br->H? Check of ret time of 2,6-diCl-pyridine (commercial ref. material): 1.86 min. NO such thing.  at rt over night  2011-05-20  0800: LC/MS: around 50% r1 in both vials.  MW/100 degr/20 min.

The vial was then capped and placed under an inert atmosphere. Dioxane (4 mL) was added and the mixture was heated to 160 Â°C for 1 h under microwave irradiation. LCMS of the crude reaction mixture indicated the presence of the desired product.  DCM (10 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture together with C-18 silica (2 g), and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The solid residue was then placed in a dry-load tube prior to chromatography. The crude product was purified by reverse-phase flash chromatography on C-18 silica, elution gradient 30 to 80% MeCN in water (1% ammonium hydroxide). Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford ethyl 2-(6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (204 mg, 67.8 %) as a beige solid.

LCMS of the crude reaction mixture indicated that the desired product had been formed while only a trace of the amine starting material remained.  DCM (20 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture together with silica (2 g) and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was then placed in a dry-load tube prior to chromatography.  The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 2.5% methanolic ammonia in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford ethyl 2-(5-nitropyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (238 mg, 86 %) as a orange solid.    BDB

The reaction mixture was heated to 110 Â°C for 3h.  The reaction mixture was passed over Celite and washed with ethylacetate. The Filtrate was concentrate to dryness to get as a syrupy brown liquid. Water 30ml was added and extracted with ethylacetate (20x 2)ml. THe organic layers are collected, dried over Sodium Sulphate and concentrated to get as a liquid.  The crude product was added to a silica gel column and was eluted with ethylacetate 0-70% Pure Collected fractions are evaporated to get as a (5-morpholinopyridin-2-yl)methanol (100 mg, 19.36 %)colorless liquid .

To the stirred mixture were palladium acetate (0.175 g, 0.78 mmol), rac-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl (0.776 g, 1.25 mmol) and cesium carbonate (7.10 g, 21.81 mmol) added, argon bubbled through the reaction for 2 min and heated then at 100 Â°C for 3 h. The reaction was not complete (the reaction was checked on a worked-up portion on GCMS and the product was 20% on GCMS). The following were added to the cooled reaction mixture: rac-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl (400 mg) and palladium acetate (100 mg) and then argon bubbled through the reaction for 1 min and heated then at 100 Â°C overnight. The reaction was checked on a worked- up portion on GCMS => 85% product. The following were added to the cooled reaction mixture: rac-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl (200 mg) and palladium acetate (50 mg) and then argon bubbled through the reaction for 1 min and heated then at 100 Â°C for 3 h => done.  The reaction was poured on a filter-funnel (silica, packed in toluene, eluted with toluene, Rf 0.32). The product came out in fractions 5-8 (Note 1) and they were pooled and the solvent was removed on the rotovap to give ethyl 4-(2-bromophenylamino)benzoate (3.00 g, 60.2 %) as a light brown oil.

The mixture was evacuated and purged with nitrogen, and warmed to 50Â°C.  In a separate vessel, 1-bromo-3-iodobenzene (240 mg, 0.85 mmol), (tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)methanamine (98 mg, 0.85 mmol) and sodium-t-butoxide (122 mg, 1.27 mmol) were suspended in toluene (3.5 mL). The resulting mixture was evacuated, purged with nitrogen and warmed to 50Â°C.  After ~30 mins, the catalyst mixture was transferred to the reaction vessel. The reaction was evacuated and purged with nitrogen and heated at 80Â°C overnight.  This reaction was combined with EN06953-06 for purification.  The mixture was filtered and purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 40% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 3-bromo-N-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)methyl)aniline (71.0 mg, 31.0 %) as a colourless oil which crystallised on standing.  The main impurity was isolated (EN06953-09-02) but this was not identified; assume it is BINAP or the catalyst- ligand complex.  B0.

Cooled to room temp.The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc (150 mL), and washed sequentially with water (75 mL), water (75 mL). The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated to afford crude product. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 30 to 50% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness - 200mg yellow oil. Contained Pd impurities.  The crude product was purified by ion exchange chromatography, using an SCX column. The desired product was eluted from the column using 1M NH3/MeOH and pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford methyl 2-(4-(3,3-difluoroazetidin-1-yl)pyridin-2-yl)acetate (42.0 mg, 39.9 %) as a yellow gum.  maybe better to avoid aq w/u and just purify by SCX column.

LCMS indicated 55% product and just a small amout of starting materials remained. The reaction was partitioned between EtOAc and water. The layers were separated and the aqueous extracted twice with EtOAc. The organic extracts were combined, filtered through a fine sinter funnel to remove a grey ppte and then dried using a phase separator cartridge. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue purified by silica gel column chromatography (0-20% ethyl acetate in heptane).

Production using the conditions which were shown to work in EN07957-76  2016-03-01  14:20; Pd2(DBA)3 (1.05 g) and BINAP (712 mg mg) was stirred in toluene (75 ml).  14:25; 2-bromo-3-methylpyridine (6.94 g), the amine (9.62 g), and sodium t-butoxide (5.43 g), was added to the mixture.  14:30; Heating at 115 Â°C. In an attempt to degas the reaction by employing vacuum to the flask good reflux, indicating a slight exotherm, took place. HPLC after 5 minutes indicated complet reaction. The mixture was allowed to cool.  2016-03-02  09:00; Water (50 ml) was followowed by 0.5 M citric acid (~75 ml) to give pH 3. The aqueous phase was extracted with another 25 ml toluene and the combined extracts were washed with water. Removal of the solvent in vacuo followed by evaporation of the solvent gave a reddish brown residue, 13.3 g.  The mixture was dissolved in toluene and purified on a 100 g silica column, 25-100% ethyl acetate over 6 columns, collecting at 300 nm. This flash was repeated on a 340 g silica column to give 6.24 g oil with a clear orange color.  About 4 g more impure material was also isolated. It was realized that preparative HPLC was required for purifiaction of the material. The impurity was mainly the diphosphine oxide originating from the BINAP.  All material was purifed by preparative HPLC, 15-65% ACN in TFA 0.1%. The eluents were neutralized with ammonia and the acetonitrile was removed in vacuo. Extraction with DCM, drying (magnesium sulfate) and removal of the solvent in vacuo (over the weekend) gave 8.21 g semicrystalline material.  The 1H-NMR and 13C NMR looks slightly dubious (too many protons and a13C shift at 3.8 ppm) but probably good enough for further synthesis.  BCA

The catalyst solution was added and the resulting mixture heated at 100 Â°C for 16 hours.  **No oxazol-2-amine present in proton NMR of crude reaction mixture.** The starting material is decomposing under the reaction conditions, could be the route of the very low productivity in the C-N couplings using these substrates. Only chloropyridine observed in the proton NMR and LCMS of the crude reaction mixture.  Conclusion: Experiment abandoned, none of the desired product isolated.  .  B.,

To an oven dried microwave vial was added 2-chloropyridine (0.095 mL, 1 mmol), oxazol-2-amine (0.187 g, 2.00 mmol), potassium carbonate (0.207 g, 1.50 mmol) and 4,4'-di-tert-butylbiphenyl (0.027 g, 0.1 mmol). The vial was then capped and purged with nitrogen. To this was added the activated catalyst solution (Solution 1) . The reaction mixture was then heated to 90 Â°C for 16 h under an inert atmosphere.  LCMS of the crude reaction mixture under basic conditions showed a peak which had the mass of the desired product, however, the chloropyridine starting material co-elutes under these conditions. Under acidic conditions none of the desired product mass was observed at Rt= 0.25 min (whereas for EN05378-80 and EN05378-81, the product mass was observed at this retention time). A product of mass corresponding to homo-coupled product was observed under basic conditions. Reaction not progressed.  Conclusion: The 't-Butyl Beller ligand' was not efficent for the coupling of these substrates under the above conditions.  B.,

To an oven dried microwave vial was added 2-chloropyridine (0.095 mL, 1 mmol), oxazol-2-amine (0.187 g, 2.00 mmol), potassium carbonate (0.207 g, 1.50 mmol) and 4,4'-di-tert-butylbiphenyl (0.027 g, 0.1 mmol). The vial was then capped and purged with nitrogen. To this was added the activated catalyst solution (Solution 1). The reaction mixture was then heated to 90 Â°C for 16 h under an inert atmosphere.  LCMS of the crude reaction mixture (Base) showed the mass peak for the desired product, however, this peak co-elutes with the Cl-pyridine starting material. LCMS of the crude reaction mixture using an acidic method showed no peak in the UV which had a mass corresponding to that of the product, however, the desired mass was observed in the MS at Rt= 0.27 min. A peak in the UV of a mass corresponding to the homocoupled bipyridine product was observed under both acidic and basic methods.  Dichloromethane was added to the crude reaction mixture together with silica (2 g). The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was placed in a dry-load tube prior to chromatography. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 10% methanolic ammonia (7 M) in DCM. 2-aminooxazole (103 mg) was recovered. The fraction containing the mass of the desired product produced 33 mg of impure material (see attached proton NMR, the desired product **_may_** be present (but it's hard to say). If this sample was to be pure it would correspond to an isolated yield of ~ 20% of the desired product, due to the fact that this is a really impure sample the real value is probably less than 10%.  Conclusion: Reaction not progressed.      B.,

LCMS: pH = 3, 2 minute run time, shows sign of product at Rt = 1.41 min  The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc (20 ml), filtered through a celite pad and concentrated to give 477 mg yellow solid.  TLC (1:1 - EtOAc : n-heptane) see diagram UV only  This was disolved in DCM, absorbed onto a samplet and purified on a 10 g Biotage SNAP column (approx column volume = 7 ml), eluting with a step-wise gradient from 0 : 10 to 4 : 6 EtOAc : n-heptane using a Thomson pump collecting 12 ml fractions.

The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC using a Waters X-Bridge reverse-phase column (5 microns silica, 30 mm diameter, 150 mm length) and decreasingly polar mixtures of water (containing 0.2% ammonium carbonate) and acetonitrile as eluent. The fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 8-(1-(3,5-difluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-2-morpholino-4-oxo-4H-chromene-6-carboxamide (11.00 mg, 33.8 %) as a pale beige foam.

The vessel was capped with a septum, placed under an atmosphere of argon, and placed in an oil bath heated to 95 Â°C. The reaction was allowed to stir at this temperature for 16 h before being allowed to cool to rt. The reaction mixture was poured into a separatory funnel containing water (~100 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate ( 2 x 100 mL). The combined organic extract was dried with MgSO4, filtered, and conc. _in vacuo_ to yield the crude product which was purified via silica gel chromatography (80 g) using ethyl acetate/hexanes (1:5) as eluent to provide pure tert-butyl 1-(3-nitrophenyl)piperidin-4-ylcarbamate (0.901 g, 56.6 %) as a light yellow solid.

The mixture was filtered through an acrodisc glassfiber filter, 25 mm, 1.0 Âµm. The filtrate (clear) was concentrated to give crude product (1,00 g). The crude was dissolved in DMSO and the product was purified by prep-HPLC on a Kromasil C8 column (10 Âµm 250x50 ID mm) using a gradient of 5-65% acetonitrile in H2O/ACN/HOAc 95/5/0.2 buffer over 30 minutes with a flow of 100 mL/min. The compounds were collected on UV at 303 nm, threshold 1000. The product containing fractions were pooled and concentrated on the rotavapor. Toluene was added and evaporated to get rid of residue of water to give the product (3-(phenylamino)phenyl)methanol (0.072 g, 11.13 %) as a transparent oil.  B42

The vessel was fitted with a septum and gas inlet and dioxane (20 mL) was added via syringe. The resulting suspension was stirred for 5 min under nitrogen. The septum and gas inlet was quickly replaced with a microwave vial cap and the mixture was heated at 150 degrees under microwave irradiation for 1h. Two reactions combined and filtered through celite. The filtrate concentrated and submitted for purification (report attached).  **Received a 3 different set up fractions:**  First set up fractions (EN02868-04-1), LC-MS looks clean but 1H NMR shows acetate peak, couldn't getrid of it even longer time on lyohillizer.  Second setup fractions combined, lyophllized, purified by ISCO column (0 - 20% MeOH-CH2Cl2 \+ 0.05% TEA). The obtained compound is a gum. It was triturated with 2 ml of EtOAc, formed a nice solid, it was filtered, washed with Et2O and dried to give 230 mg of white solid. 1H NMR showed slight shift of couple of peaks, it may be due to the protonation. 63 mg of this compound registered and submitted (EN02868-04-2).  Third setup fractions showed no required product peaks, was discarded.  EN02868-04-1, the remaining material after submission (EN02868-04-2), the filtrate of EN02868-04-2 combined, concentrated, treated with 3 g of MP- carbonate in THF (30 ml). After 1 h stirring, it was filtered washed with THF, concentrated, triturated with CH3CN, filtered and dried to give white color solid (EN02868-04-3).  Conclusion: Product isolated  BWU

LCMS of the crude reaction mixture indicated that the desired product had been formed with very small amounts of side products apparent.  DCM (20 mL) was added to the crude reaction mixture together with silica (2 g) and the solvent was removed from the reaction mixture under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was then placed in a dry-load tube prior to chromatography. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 5% methanolic ammonia in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford the desired product in 74% yield and 92% purity by LCMS. The product was triturated with MeCN to give a solid which was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give ethyl 2-(5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-ylamino)oxazole-5-carboxylate (185 mg, 61.5 %) as a cream solid. This material was shown to be > 95% pure based on proton NMR strength.  Conclusion: The desired product was formed in moderate yield and high purity.  B@>

The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc (3 mL) and filtered. The solid was washed with EtOAc and the collected organic layers were evaporated to dryness, to give the crude product.  The compound was purified by preparative HPLC on a Kromasil C8 column (10 Âµm 250x20 ID mm) using a gradient of 10-50% acetonitrile in H2O/ACN/FA 95/5/0.2 buffer, over 20 minutes with a flow of 19 mL/min. The compounds were detected by UV at 230nm. (15,3 mg pure product).  The reaction was repeated at 80C, RT and 110C on microwave, overnight and a weekend: the yield remains very low for all conditions except for the reaction at RT (no product at all).  B97

Palladium(II) acetate (0.607 g, 2.70 mmol) was added to 2,4-dichloropyridine (5.00 g, 33.79 mmol), 4-methylpyrimidin-2-amine (3.69 g, 33.79 mmol), 9,9-Dimethyl-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)xanthene (2.346 g, 4.05 mmol) and Cesium carbonate (22.02 g, 67.57 mmol) in dioxane (150 mL) at 20ÂºC under nitrogen. The resulting suspension was stirred at 100 Â°C for 90 minutes. Complete reaction by LCMS, cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was then filtered, washed with DCM and filtrate concentrated _in vacuo_ to give a yellow gum. This was then dissolved in DCM (200 mL), washed with water (200 mL) and brine (200 mL). The organic layer was passed through phase separating cartridge and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was suspended in DCM, isolubles filtered off and dried to give EN01580-50-1, N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)-4-methylpyrimidin-2-amine (2.859 g, 38.3 %), as a yellow solid. The fltrate was then purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 5% MeOH in DCM. No separation acheived so all fractions containing product concentrated _in vacuo_. The residue was suspended in acetonitile/water, insolubles filtered off and dried to give EN01580-50-2, N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)-4-methylpyrimidin-2-amine (0.934 g, 12.5 %), as a yellow solid. The filtrate was then purified by preparative HPLC (Waters XBridge Prep C18 OBD column, 5Âµ silica, 50 mm diameter, 150 mm length), using decreasingly polar mixtures of water (containing 0.1% formic acid) and MeCN as eluents. Fractions containing the desired compound were evaporated to dryness to afford EN01580-50-3, N-(4-chloropyridin-2-yl)-4-methylpyrimidin-2-amine (0.511 g, 6.85 %), as a white solid.    B53

The resulting yellow solution was degassed (vacuum) and then tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (4.19 mg, 4.58 Âµmol), Xantphos (5.52 mg, 9.54 Âµmol), and sodium tert-butoxide (0.026 g, 0.27 mmol) were added. Another 2 mL of toluene and 0.340 mL of tert-butanol were also added. The resulting mixture was subjected to microwave conditions for 30 min (300W, 110Â°C) and then cooled. The biphasic red-brown/brown-black mixture was poured into saturated aqueous sodium chloride and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. The resulting residue was purified by falsh column chromatography (SiO2, 0-100% ethyl acetate in hexanes) and then preparative LCMS (C18, ethanol in water containing ammonium carbonate, pH 10). The resulting white solid was repurified a third time via preparative HPLC (C18, acetonitrile in water containing ammonium carbonate, pH 10) to afford 6-(furan-2-ylsulfonyl)-N-(quinolin-3-yl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2,6-naphthyridin-1-amine (7.60 mg, 9.80 %) of 95% purity as a white solid.

The mixture was purged with Ar for 5 min, then heated at 95 oC for 4 hrs. After cooled to RT, EtOAc (30 mL) was added. The organic layer was washed with water (3 x 30 mL), brine (30 mL), dried over MgSO4, filetred and concentrated. The residue was purified via combiflush (0 - 20% EtOAc/Hexane; 40 g column) to give the desired product as a clear reddish liquid. LCMS and H-NMR look good. 290 mg  Conclusion: reaction progressed to give desired product in 49% yield.  B31

The reaction was cooled to RT, and filtered off the solid (Cs2CO3). The filter was concentrated, re-dissolved in EtOAc, washed with waster, dried through MgSO4, and evaporated to give an orange gum.  **_September 14 2015_**  The orange gum was added to a Biotage column and was eluted with 10-100%EtOAc in Heptane. Collected fractions.  The column was stuck as 37% EtOAc in Heptane. A lot of CH2Cl2 was pushed through the column manually, and then continued the elution with 0-100% EtOAc in DCM. Collected fractions.  The product fractions were identified, combined based on LCMS and TLC, and evaporated to give a white solid as the desired product (EN07946-27-001). Based on LCMS, it was 98% pure; based on NMR in DMSO, it was > 95%pure; _however, based on NMR in CDCl3, there were ~30% impurity in the aromatic proton region._  The product was used for next step without further purification.

The reaction was then treated with 4-bromo-2-chlorobenzonitrile (0.7 g, 3.23 mmol) and was allowed to stir at 80Â°C for 5 h. The mixture was then filtered over celite and celite was washed with heptanes. The mixture was condensed under reduced pressure and the crude material was purified on preparative HPLC MS using the short high pH shallow gradient method (Mobile phase: 50-70% B; A: H2O with 10 mM NH4CO3 and 0.375% NH4OH v/v, B: CH3CN, 10 min run) on XBridge Prep C18 OBD, 30x50 mm, 5 mm, Waters reverse phase column, to afford tert-butyl 4-(3-chloro-4-cyanophenyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (0.490 g, 47.1 %) as a white solid.

Start heating 14:30 -  IPC was taken after 18 h **IPC1 LCMS** , seems difficult to identify if any of the desired product was formed.  Made an aqueous wash between citric acid/water and ethyl acetate, tedious separation, analysed the two phases IPC2 LCMS but still impossible to identify any product neither in the organic phase IPC3 LCMS.  **No evidence of product formation.**  The phases were discarded and the reaction judged as failed  B75

Pd2(dba)3 (14.79 mg, 0.02 mmol) and cesium carbonate (210 mg, 0.65 mmol) were added.  The solution was degassed, filled with N2, capped, then microwaved at 150C for 30 min.  The organic solvent was removed. TLC showed two closely associated peaks, so product was purified via Gilson. Appropriate fractions were collected, concentrated by rotovap, and dried in the oven overnight. LCMS, HPLC, and NMR revealed desired product. See attachments.  BOM

The reaction was heated to 80 Â°C and was stirred for 10 min. To the flask was then added tert-butyl piperazine-1-carboxylate (0.230 g, 1.23 mmol), cesium carbonate (0.201 g, 0.62 mmol), potassium carbonate (0.171 g, 1.23 mmol), and 18-CROWN-6 (0.033 g, 0.12 mmol). The reaction was then treated with 4-bromo-2-fluoro-1-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (0.300 g, 1.23 mmol) and was allowed to stir at 80Â°C 5 h.  **LCMS High pH:**  SM Amine Rt = 1.21 min  Product Rt = 2.14 min, Rf = 0.28  The reaction mixture was filtered through celite and washed with small amounts of DCM. The filtrate was evaporated in vacuo to a residue that was taken up in a mixture of Heptane and EtOAc (4:1). The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel, eluting with mixtures of EtOAc and heptane, to afford tert-butyl 4-(3-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate (0.258 g, 59.9 %) as a solid.
